===========================================
This md file will contain all explanations and justifications about the choices taken during the realization of the sprint.
#Building 4
> ##Network addresses and VLAN Database table
> ![Network Address Tree](Figures/arvore.PNG)
> The VLAN's represented in the figure are described in the following table:

> The VLAN's were determined by their number of nodes (a VLAN that support more nodes need more valid IP's). As this is a simulation and was used a few number of PC's, there are many IP's unused. The IP's unused allow the building to grow smoothly.

> ##Cisco Packet Tracer simulation
> ![Simulation](Figures/simulation.PNG)
> * As we can see in the picture, for each CP we have at least one pc connected. There are cases where the telephone, and the access point are also connected.<br>
> * The layout of the simulation followed the same pattern as the defined one of sprint 1. Each PC in the simulation represents all the end-user nodes described in the sprint description.<br>
> * All communication between switches (can represent HC, IC, CP...) are in truck mode, otherwise, we worked in access mode, thus allowing all switches to access the building's VLANs.
> * As we used 'PT-Empty' switch type, we had to add manually the needed ports to support all connections. For fibre connections we used FFE ports, and for copper connections we used CFE ports.
> * The laptop is connected to the network through a Wi-Fi connection. As the configuration is lost when we close the program, the next figure represents the configuration of the laptop, so it can't be lost.
>

> As we can see, the IP is one of the valid IP's defined for the Wi-Fi VLAN.<br>
> All switches and routers configuration are saved in configuration files.
>
> ###Testing connections
> To test if all components can connect to each other, we used the 'Add Simple PDU'. The following 3 figures represents it:
> * From PC0:

> ###Building's VLAN devices
> For all VLANs, we have at least 1 device connected to it, to test the connection between all VLANs.

> ###Routing tables
>
> Each device, when requests to communicate with another device in the network or outside it, has to know what will be to the path to achieve the destination.<br>
> The routing tables have that function, define the paths to establish a connection between all the services. The following table represents all routing tables associated with their device.
