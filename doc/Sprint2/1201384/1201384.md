#Building 1

> The VLAN's represented in the figure are described in the following table:

> The VLAN's were determined by their number of nodes (a VLAN that support more nodes need more valid IP's). As this is a simulation and was used a few number of PC's, there are many IP's unused. The IP's unused allow the building to grow smoothly.

> ##Cisco Packet Tracer simulation
> ![Simulation](Figures/MainImage.PNG)
> * As we can see in the picture, for each CP we have at least one pc connected. There are cases where the telephone, and the access point are also connected.<br>
> * The layout of the simulation followed the same pattern as the defined one of sprint 1. Each PC in the simulation represents all the end-user nodes described in the sprint description.<br>
> * All communication between switches (can represent HC, IC, CP...) are in truck mode, otherwise, we worked in access mode, thus allowing all switches to access the building's VLANs.
> * As we used 'PT-Empty' switch type, we had to add manually the needed ports to support all connections. For fibre connections we used FFE ports, and for copper connections we used CFE ports.
> * The laptop is connected to the network through a Wi-Fi connection. As the configuration is lost when we close the program, the next figure represents the configuration of the laptop, so it can't be lost.
>
> ![laptop](Figures/Screenshot_15.PNG)
> As we can see, the IP is one of the valid IP's defined for the Wi-Fi VLAN.<br>
> All switches and routers configuration are saved in configuration files.
>
> ###Testing connections
> To test if all components can connect to each other, we used the 'Add Simple PDU'. The following 3 figures represents it:
> * From PC1:

> * From Laptop:

> * From Server:

> ###Building's VLAN devices
> For all VLANs, we have at least 1 device connected to it, to test the connection between all VLANs.

> ###Backbone
> The backbone is represented by the MC and IC switches and by the router of each building. The main responsibility of the backbone is to permit communication between all the buildings.<br>
> 
> ###Internet connection
> To provide an internet connection to the network, we use an ISP router, that simulates the internet provider, a cloud, and a DSL modem (PL3). The router R0B1 makes the connection between the internet elements and the network, so it has defined in its routing table, the forwarding to the different IPs of the network.
> 
> ###Routing tables
>
> Each device, when requests to communicate with another device in the network or outside it, has to know what will be to the path to achieve the destination.<br>
> The routing tables have that function, define the paths to establish a connection between all the services. The following table represents all routing tables associated with their device.
