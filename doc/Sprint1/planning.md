# 1. Technical decisions and coordination #
* Backbone cable types: Multimode Optical Fiber with SC connectors
* Copper cable wiring: CAT7 with 568B connector
* When it comes to redundancy, we opted to create alternative an path on the HC-CP connections, with no double wiring, and also on the IC-HC with quadruple wiring. On the HC-CP connections, we chose the star topology with a root on the HC and a ring topology between CP's. For the IC-HC connections we also chose a ring topology.
